In December 2018 we created some analysis and visualisation to support [a story on cuts to the number of lollipop men and women near schools](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46514670).

The number of them funded by councils in Great Britain has fallen by 1,500, almost a quarter, in five years, figures obtained by the BBC showed.

The data for the story was obtained through the use of Freedom of Information requests to local authorities.

The BBC contacted every local authority with responsibility for lollipop people. Two thirds of councils (133) replied with comparable data, meaning the real loss of staff could be substantially higher.
